<h1>Rationale</h1>

<h2>A band is only a name</h2>

<p>A band is only a name, nothing else. A band's country is determined by
countries of its participants. Thus, a single band be rooted in multiple
countries, and the countries may change as the lineup changes.</p>


<h2>Only original conceptual albums</h2>

<p>There may be plenty versions of an album. The goal is only to present the
album as it was intended at the moment of its creation. That means, bonus tracks
and alternative covers are generally out, unless the first release didn't have
the intended form due to censorship or other problems.</p>

<p>There may be valuable bonus tracks that are present only on some alternative
release but not on any of the original albums. But that is it: they are not part
of any original album. If there is need, such a release can be listed on its
own, and it would be considered a compilation including the original album and
these other tracks.</p>

<p>There is no media info. Since an album is a concept, it's unimportant whether
it was printed on vinyl, CD or tape. The media is just a way to share the album
with others. There are digital-only albums too. There are specialised sites with
information about dates and forms of physical album releases.</p>

<p>The cover picture is technically a part of the package, but it is also a
graphical conceptual supplement to the album, thus it is included. The original
covers are preferred over the covers on the reissued/relicensed packages, unless
the original cover was not the intended cover.</p>

<p>The album's date should ideally be the date when the recording was finished.
But since that information is rarely available, the first publication is used as
the closest approximation.</p>

	<h2>Only actual performers</h2>

	<p>Sometimes credits on an album metion members that were not actually recording the album. Also, many performers are dismissed as "session" substitutes. Here the goal is to list musicians actually performing on the recording, for each individual track, not copy the published lineup. It doesn't matter that "session" musicians didn't go on tours with the band or were not "officially" in it: that is irrelevant to the recording. Any trivia like that can be put in the free-form notes to the album.</p>

	<h2>No classification</h2>

	<p>Each album, as long as it is original, is treated the same regardless of its total playing time. There is an established practice to classify releases as "EP", "full-length", "demo" and so on, but there are no strict criteria for that classification. A "demo" may become a "full-length" or "EP", once it is published. There are also cases when a band establishes a "label" just to publish their album and it becomes debatable for some whether that is a "real thing" or still a demo.</p>

	<p>Also, whether an album is a "full-length" or "mini" or "EP" is subjective. There are releases considered to be EPs which are longer than some "full-length" albums.</p>

<p>The track-by-track info about who wrote lyrics and who wrote music is
nice to have, but too cumbersome and it's not available in most cases
anyways. Those who are interested can read it in the free-form description.</p>
