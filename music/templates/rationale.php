<h1>Rationale</h1>

<section>
	<h2>Only original conceptual albums</h2>

	<p>There may be plenty versions of an album. The goal is only to present the album as it was intended at the moment of its creation. That means, bonus tracks and alternative covers are generally out, unless the first release didn't have the intended form due to censorship or other problems.</p>

	<p>There may be valuable bonus tracks that are present only on some alternative release but not on any of the original albums. But that is it: they are not part of any original album. If there is need, such a release can be listed on its own, and it would be considered a compilation including the original album and some new tracks.</p>

	<h2>Only actual performers</h2>

	<p>Sometimes credits on an album metion members that were not actually recording the album. Also, many performers are dismissed as "session" substitutes. Here the goal is to list musicians actually performing on the recording, for each individual track, not copy the published lineup. It doesn't matter that "session" musicians didn't go on tours with the band or were not "officially" in it: that is irrelevant to the recording. Any trivia like that can be put in the free-form notes to the album.</p>

	<h2>No classification</h2>

	<p>Each album, as long as it is original, is treated the same regardless of its total playing time. There is an established practice to classify releases as "EP", "full-length", "demo" and so on, but there are no strict criteria for that classification. A "demo" may become a "full-length" or "EP", once it is published. There are also cases when a band establishes a "label" just to publish their album and it becomes debatable for some whether that is a "real thing" or still a demo.</p>

	<p>Also, whether an album is a "full-length" or "mini" or "EP" is subjective. There are releases considered to be EPs which are longer than some "full-length" albums.</p>
